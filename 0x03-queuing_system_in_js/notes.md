\*\* Job scheduling

Imagine your application as a grand orchestra, with each task representing a skilled musician. Without a conductor, each musician might play their part at their own pace, resulting in a disjointed and chaotic performance. Similarly, without a job scheduler, tasks in your application may run independently, leading to resource conflicts, delays, and suboptimal performance.

Just as a conductor adapts to unforeseen circumstances during a live performance, a job scheduler handles exceptions and failures in your application. It gracefully manages errors, reschedules failed tasks, and ensures that the show goes on smoothly, maintaining the reliability and resilience of your application.

Handling time consuming or resource intensive tasks.

Examples of job schedulers:

\*\*\* Bull

1. Coordinating and synchronizing tasks in a distributed/ microservices system.
2. background processing and task offloading.
3. Task scheduling and automation.
4. Delayed and retry mechanisms.
5. Job queues and workload balancing.

purpose of queues:

1. setting up communication channels between microservices.
2. Offloading heavy tasks from a process.
3. Avoiding single point of failure.
